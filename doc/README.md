Title:
Stock Prediction with Emotions

Summary:
Our team aims to design a website that provides both the prediction for the stock market and the relationship between companies and people’s sentiments towards them. Users can register and receive updates about the stock or companies they follow.

Description:
We will create a website that predicts possible trends in the stock market for users based on the past trend of the stock market. Moreover, we are also interested in seeing the relationship between the change in a company’s stock market and people’s most recent sentiments towards the company. Many website applications have functionalities such as predictions on future trends, yet we are adding one more fun functionality which is the relationship between stock trends and people’s sentiments. Hence we will focus on building these two main functions on our website. Furthermore, users can register on our website and subscribe to the updates of the companies or stocks they follow.
